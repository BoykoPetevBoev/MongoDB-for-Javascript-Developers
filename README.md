## About

This course will teach you how to use MongoDB as the database for a Node.js application.

You will play the role of a back-end developer for a Node.js application, where your job is to implement the application's communication with MongoDB. Using the Node.js driver you will read and write data to the database, use the aggregation framework, manage the configuration of the database client, and create a robust application by handling exceptions and timeouts.

You'll build the back-end for a movie-browsing application called MFlix.

Using the Node.js driver for MongoDB, you will implement MFlix's basic functionality. This includes basic and complex movie searches, registering new users, and posting comments on the site.

You will also add more features to the MFlix application. This includes writing analytical reports, increasing the durability of MFlix's connection with MongoDB, and implementing security best practices.
